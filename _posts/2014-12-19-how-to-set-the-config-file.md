**First part** Reach out and touch it

Enjoy the simplicity of Ubuntu's intuitive interface. Fast, secure and with thousands of apps to choose from, the sleek Ubuntu desktop experience is now optimised for multitouch devices, including laptop trackpads and touchscreens, as well as the familiar keyboard and mouse.

**Part 2** Smarter searching.

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS includes a wealth of smart filters to make it faster and easier to find the content you need, whether itâ€™s stored on your computer or on the web.

Type any query into the Dash home and the Smart Scopes server will determine which categories of content are the most relevant to your search, returning only the best results. The server constantly improves its results by learning which categories and results are most useful to you over time.
