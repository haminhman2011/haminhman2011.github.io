**First part** Reach out and touch it

Enjoy the simplicity of Ubuntu's intuitive interface. Fast, secure and with thousands of apps to choose from, the sleek Ubuntu desktop experience is now optimised for multitouch devices, including laptop trackpads and touchscreens, as well as the familiar keyboard and mouse.

**Part 2** Smarter searching.

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS includes a wealth of smart filters to make it faster and easier to find the content you need, whether it’s stored on your computer or on the web.

Type any query into the Dash home and the Smart Scopes server will determine which categories of content are the most relevant to your search, returning only the best results. The server constantly improves its results by learning which categories and results are most useful to you over time.

**Part3**, First look: Unity 8

If you’re interested in the future of computing and you want to see how Ubuntu will look further down the line, you can download a preview version of Unity 8, Ubuntu’s next-generation user interface. Designed to support a single user experience across the smartphone, the tablet and the PC, it uses the current version of Mir, the cross-platform display server being developed by the Ubuntu community. Do note, however, that Mir only works with open-source graphics drivers at present.
